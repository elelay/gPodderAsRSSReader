 Dependencies
 ============

   * python (>= 2.5) with sqlite3 support
   * python-gtk2 (>= 2.12)
   * python-feedparser
   * python-mygpoclient (>= 1.4; http://thp.io/2010/mygpoclient/)
   * python-dbus (optional, but highly recommended)

 If your Python installation does not come with "sqlite3" support,
 you can either re-compile Python with support for sqlite3 or use
 the "pysqlite" package from http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/

 Additional dependencies for iPod synchronization support:

   * python-gpod (libgpod's Python bindings)
   * At least one of the following packages:
     - mplayer (recommended for video podcasts)
     - python-eyed3 (eyeD3 library)

 Additional dependencies for MTP-based device synchronization support:

   * libmtp (>= 1.0.0)
     Please note that the previously-required "pymtp" module is now included in
     the gPodder distribution as "gpodder.gpopymtp", and therefore no longer
     needed as special dependency. You still need a recent version of libmtp.

 Additional dependencies for converting OGGs to MP3s on iPod sync:
 
   * oggdec (for decoding OGG files)
   * lame (for encoding MP3 files)

 Additional dependencies if you want Bluetooth file send support:

   * python-hildon
   * python-conic

 Additional dependencies for the Soundcloud plug-in:

   * Python >= 2.6 (as this includes the "json" module) OR
   * Python < 2.6 with the "simplejson" module (Debian: python-simplejson)

 Additional dependencies if you want to install from source:

 Installation
 ============

 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-2.20.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-2.20/
   make install

 If you have any problems, please visit the gPodder website or mail the 
 gPodder mailing list (see below for more information).

 ================================
 Portable mode / roaming profiles

 You can set the environment variables GPODDER_HOME and GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR
 to point to locations for storing the database and downloaded files:

    GPODDER_HOME ........... location for configuration and database
    GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR ... location for downloaded episodes

 You can use this to have different configurations for gPodder or to put
 gPodder's data directly on your MP3 player or USB disk, for example:

    export GPODDER_HOME=/media/usbdisk/gpodder-data/
    export GPODDER_DOWLOAD_DIR=/media/usbdisk/podcasts/
    gpodder
